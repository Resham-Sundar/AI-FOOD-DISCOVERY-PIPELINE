        "description": "Beautiful, quaint place right opposite ulsoor lake. The interiors are gorgeous and give the perfect ambience. The service is really good and the staff is very sweet and attentive.  Fish curries are available in varying levels of spiciness, you can inform the staff based on preference. Tava fry and rava fry for any kinds of fish or prawn is so delicious. The curries are very delicious with red rice or white rice. Prawn sukkha was so amazing, goes really well with neer dosa. They have a good variety and quality of fish. Very fresh, very good food. Hearty meal for decent prices. Solkadi, kokum and buttermilk make for really good drinks as well. Highly recommended for a great seafood meal.Vaidehi V \u2014 Google reviewTo start off, this restaurant has shifted location and is now on Assaye Road, Ulsoor. The place is a bit small for my liking but it's more airy. The quality of food on offer like the Prawn Raw Mango Curry and Chicken Roce Curry were excellent. The service is decent and it's most definitely value for money. Check this place out.Varun V \u2014 Google reviewIt is a very good place to have seafood.The staff were friendly and patient.Due to the place being packed, we had to remind them of our food, but it wasn't too bad.The food was awesome, though for some food, the quantity may seem less for some items (though the price was less and we were ravenous, so we quickly finished everything).Would recommend this place for any seafood lover.Aneesh N \u2014 Google reviewAmazing sea food place. Was a chance find one day while hungry around Ulsoor and have been hooked onto the food. If you are a fish lover and love Mangalore dishes, a must try. Super clean, great taste and great pricing.Rajroop B \u2014 Google reviewMangalore Pearl.....the name suits it well.Fresh tasty fish....worth more than Pearls.Sit, Relax and enjoy.....The place is very cool. It's on the 2nd floor. There is a staircase to climb up and than you can take the lift to the 2nd floor. The ambience is very good. Very clean place. The washrooms are very clean.The attendants were very cooperative and helpful. We being Goans, we just loved all the preparations. The fish, prawns and crabs were very fresh and tasty.We ordered pork Chilly. The masala was just yummy not too spicy. We enjoyed it with sannas.  Must try.Later we tried chicken cutlets. They were nice and crispy and tasty too.We ordered kingfish rawa fry. It was nice and juicy, the masala was just nice and fried very well.We also ordered Pomfret (full) tava fry .....mouth watering....We ordered red rice (boiled rice ...in Goa). It was nice and well cooked not very hard or soft.The crab curry was very tasty too. There were about 6 pieces of crabs. The crabs were full of flesh.The prawns and rice dumpings were yummy too. Only we were so full that we could not finish  the rice dumpings.Later we had bread pudding and caramel pudding.We really had a very good time and enjoyed the food. Five of us. The bill was only Rs 2500/- @ Rs.500/- per head.Only  the fresh lime soda and the kokum juice were a little too sweet.  So next time you order tell them you want it less sweet.The owners are from Mangalore and the preparation was very authentic mangalorean style. Just loved it.If you want to have fresh fish, please do visit this restaurant.The best part is they have a different menu every day.Mondays they are closed.There is a valet parking service. But if you want you can drive behind this restaurant building and park on the road sideThe service is very quick too.Enjoy fresh fish in Bangalore on your holidays at a very reasonable price too and friendly atmosphere.Judas M \u2014 Google reviewHave been to this place multiple times for lunch and dinner, mostly crowded during lunch hour.Have tried their mutton pepper fry, squid roast, chicken roce curry, seer fish fry. Usually a wait time of 15 to 20 mins. Service is quick.A nice seafood restaurant at an affordable price.Odyssey \u2014 Google reviewIf you've ever properly munched fish in Mangalore, you wouldn't give this place 4 or 5 stars. I dined at Machali, Shetty\u2019s Kitchen, and Girimanja in Mangalore, and the taste here doesn't even match 25% of it. I ordered Anjal and Bangude, and the taste was utterly disappointing. Don't be misled by the name and reviews\u2014avoid this restaurant.Sanju R \u2014 Google reviewPros:Had delightful dining experience with good food at reasonable prices.Tried prawns, fish mango curry, crab, pork pepper, rice, and neer dosa. All the items were delicious, though personal preferences might vary.My favorites were the prawns, pork, and neer dosa.cons:the seating can fill up quickly, so you might have to wait about 15-20 minutes during busy times.Overall, Very satisfied with both the food and the service.Arjun R \u2014 Google reviewAwesome place to have some coastal food in Bangalore. Went there for lunch on a Saturday and had to wait for 15 minutes before getting a table. The service is super quick and the staff is always ready to help you with recommendations. The food was served very quickly and tasted amazing. I discovered Solkadi for the first time and I am going to look for it on every restaurant that I visit now. A must visit and very decently priced with great portions.Taniya \u2014 Google reviewIt is really tough to review a place that has good ratings and you feel that you have had better Mangalore food. This is my review and what i felt. Squid ghee roast i ve had better ones. Even the curry i dint feel like proper shetty style food. It was just average. Definitely you can try but i can give 4 ratings. There are better places in Bangalore. One thing i would appreciate is the price, very affordable. The tava fry was good apart from that the proper Mangalore masala i dint feel that. Appreciate the service . One last thing is that parking was troublePM M \u2014 Google reviewGreat Managalorean cuisine. Food wasn\u2019t super spicy or oily which was great. They have a decent number of dishes for Vegetarians as well.Mihir B \u2014 Google reviewWe visited The Mangalore Pearl with family and had a fantastic time. This was our first visit, recommended by friends, and it exceeded our expectations. If you're a seafood lover or want to experience authentic Tulunadu cuisine in Bengaluru, this restaurant is a must-visit.They are meticulous about the quality of their ingredients. The owner personally selects fresh seafood from the market every morning, ensuring the highest quality for their dishes. Consequently, the menu changes daily based on the availability of fresh seafood.We enjoyed prawns ghee roast, chicken lollipop, neer dosa, chicken sukka, pink perch tava fry, silver fish deep rava fry, boiled rice with silver fish curry, kokum solkadi, buttermilk, and caramel custard. Each dish had a unique flavor, with a perfect blend of spices, and we ended up reordering several times.Overall, an outstanding dining experience. Highly recommended!Subrahmanya N \u2014 Google reviewOne of the best seafood restaurants in Bangalore , taste is just amazing with meals, roti and fish items in the menu. Deserts is a must try as they have lot of options. Pricing is good for coastal food but it's worth it once you have a good fill. Fast service and they have beverages also which are good. Try gheeroast items,prawns fry and kor rotti also to get that authentic coastal food feelingThere might be waiting here and parking is a problem.Prajwal R \u2014 Google reviewMangalore Pearl Restaurant at Ulsoor provided an enjoyable dining experience that pleasantly surprised me. As a fan of Coorg-style cuisine, which shares similarities with Kerala but offers unique dishes, I was curious to explore their menu. Visiting around 3 PM, the restaurant was moderately crowded, but finding a side seat was easy.Perusing the menu, I initially felt a bit indecisive but settled on ordering Neer dosa and Tilapia fish fillet, opting for Pork Sarpotal to try something different from the typical Pork Pandi curry. I also ordered a refreshing kokum juice. When the dishes arrived, I was initially disappointed by the appearance of the Pork Sarpotal, reminiscent of a  chicken curry from my hostel days.However, my doubts vanished upon tasting. The finely sliced pork, combined with pork liver and a subtle sweetness, paired exceptionally well with the soft Neer dosa. The Tilapia fillet fry was another highlight, bursting with flavor.The ambiance of the restaurant was pleasant, with a neat and spacious layout, complemented by coastal seafood-themed decorations and cartoons. Considering the quality and quantity of the meal, the cost of around 600 rupees was reasonable.Overall, Mangalore Pearl Restaurant delivered a very good experience, especially for families who enjoy Mangalore-style and seafood cuisine. I would highly recommend it for a satisfying and authentic Mangalorean dining experience.In my second visit, pork pepper fry was utter flop. Where as Manthal fry was delicious.Arun B \u2014 Google reviewTop quality sea food with reasonable prices. Definitely finger licking good. It is crowded on weekends. Make sure to reach early as there might be a waiting time of 15-30 mins. 4 wheeler parking is an issue.Lawrence G \u2014 Google reviewHeaven for seafood lovers!!Good quality and tasty food at affordable price.For those hotels who claim that quality food comes with a price, Mangalore Pearl is the answer. You necessarily don\u2019t have to loot customers for offering tasty food.Filled my tummy and filled my heart as well !!Must try : Neer dosa and Chicken ghee roastVISHNU K \u2014 Google reviewMust visit when in Bangalore. The ghee roast prawns were superb \u2764\ufe0fBest was the raw mango fish curry and boiled ricePrakriti D \u2014 Google reviewVisit this place for an amazing sea food experience.Do try their chicken uruval.Fish tawa fry is also a must try.Car parking is a hassle.Pruthuvainya G \u2014 Google reviewWe tried many items here including chicken ghee roast, seer fish tawa fry, squid rava fry, neer dosa, and their signature drinks.Except squid rava fry every other items were disaster. I have no idea why this restaurant got this much rating.Lack of parking space, long waiting for seats, very slow service. It\u2019s not at all worthy.I know of some other restaurants in banglore which serves exceptionally good manglorean food. ( Anupams Coast2Coast is an example ).I\u2019ve travelled all the way from Electronic City to try their food based on the review. But I was wrong.Pranav R \u2014 Google reviewThe place has great service and the food is amazing. The drinks were good (especially solkadi). The prawns ghee roast and chicken uruwal tasted great.The deserts both the bread pudding and caramel pudding were similar but tasted fabulous. The seer fish curry was good.Arjun # \u2014 Google review",
